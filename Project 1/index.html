            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 - 27 July
            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Naidu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
            He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
            administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
            was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
            military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as
            the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic
            missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a
            pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
            test by India in 1974.
